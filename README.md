 Optimization and Inversion Techniques

1. inversion_simulated_annealing_sedimentary_basin: Direct and Inversion of a model sedimentary basin using Simulated Annealing. According to Nagy, it is possible to describe an arbitrary geological configuration in subsurface considering blocks composed of prisms with different dimensions. The distribution of vertical components associated with the gravitational attraction of a right rectangular prism with density varying with depth following a third order polynomial can be used to find this geological configuration through through the use of a global optimization algorithms.
